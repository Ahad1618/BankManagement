# BankManagement1
Its a simple bank management project built in c language, i have wrote this code in my first semester of university.
Simple programming fundamentals concepts are used:
1-Conditions
2-Iterations
3-Arrays and their manipulations
4-Functions and Recursions
5-Structures
6-File Handling
The code is made persistent using proper file handling,both binary and text files are used in order to save data.
->example.bin is the binary file that is a simple file based database holding all the information of the accounts registered in the management system.
->Temp is .txt file that is used to save the number of records/accounts in the main database of the bank management system.
->This number of records is updated every time a new account is created in the main database.

NOTE:
->Go to admin panel and then view the database in order to see information about any account.
